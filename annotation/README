Prerequisites:

Django 1.0
postgresql
Python 2.5+ with psycopg2 (Python 2.4 might also work)

The database has to be set up and inserted in the right places (marked with TODO).
A couple other places are also marked with TODO.


Instructions:

To prime the annotation pipeline, a list of interactions (in STRING textmining_interact.tsv format)
has to be imported with extract_abstracts.py and put into a database (using Postgres). Then, run
"sync" to import the candidate list. Next, start the server with "run" and start annotating.

After the annotation is done, call the URL http://server/p450/candidates/export/ to dump the results.


Limitations:

- no support for concurrency (two people could be working on the same item)
- no support for independent cross checking
